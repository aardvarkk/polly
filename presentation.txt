- Economic Leakage.
- It may not be the worst type of leakage you can imagine, but it's still pretty bad.

- The Yukon Government spends a lot of money on procurement
- Accommodations for film scouts, fire extinguisher repair, four interpretive panels for the Kluane Lake Overlook.
- How much of that money is given to Yukon-based vendors?
- Any dollar that doesn't go to Yukon-based companies is called "economic leakage"
- Should the Yukon Government focus more on dealing with local providers?
- What if Yukon residents and businesses could access purchase data to seek opportunities to become a Yukon-sourced option?

- The answers to these questions rely on a unified, categorized view of government procurement spending.
- It sounds great. But it doesn't exist.

- Procurement spending can happen in various ways:
- There are over a thousand credit cards which can be used for smaller purchases.
- There are also contracts put out to tender, some of which total over 100 million dollars in value.
- Unfortunately, each of these procurement methods stores data in disparate forms which make it difficult to examine holistically.

- If we could meaningfully combine these datasets, we see two big wins:
- 1. Citizens would have a powerful tool to search for opportunities to provide Yukon-based sourcing
- 2. The Yukon Government would be able to compellingly demonstrate their commitment to local companies

- Welcome to Polly Data (next)

- Polly Data is an app to view government procurement spending.

- Let's start by looking at year-over-year spending
- What we've done is to separate all "In Yukon" spending from all "Out of Yukon" spending
- By hovering over the chart, we're able to see at a glance how much money was spent in each category (demo)
- We can also easily hide either category to see a better-scaled version of spending
- Let's take a look only at spending "Out of Yukon" (demo)
- We see a peak in the year 2013 where over 46 million dollars were spent "Out of Yukon"

- Moving along, we examine the percentage of purchase value made in or out of the Yukon across the years 2007 to 2018.
- We see that approximately 10% of all procurement money spent in the last ten years was spent out of territory.

- Now let's take a look at per-Department spending over the years
- We see an obvious outlier: Highways and Public Works spending dwarfs all other departments, whether in or out of the Yukon

- Polly Data is powered by a flexible API to retrieve and slice data in various ways
- With it, we can rapidly aggregate procurement data across many variables, such as department, vendor, category, amount, and fiscal year. (demo?)

SHOW BIG TRANSACTIONS OUT OF YUKON

- Here's an example where we've searched for the single largest purchase outside of the Yukon
- The purchase is for Warm Mix Asphalt Pavement Overlay and was provided by Hoban Equipment Limited from Salmon Arm, BC
- Now we're not asphalt experts, but perhaps there's a Yukon-based company that would have been thrilled to receive this 9.2 million dollar contract?

- Now that a system for combining and categorizing purchases in a coherent way has been developed, and a web app is in place to visualize the data in a myriad of ways, it's easy to extend this system to provide other views into the data
- Using Polly Data, both citizens and the government are now empowered to examine procurement spending data in compelling new ways

VISA - 2% of spending in 2013 - 1000 individual cards and 16 corporate cards (about 6 million out of 300 million)
< 25,000 -> Direct
>= 25,000 (goods) -> TMS
>= 75,000 (construction and services) -> TMS
